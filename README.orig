################# MELT SYNTAX ##################################

This script is mainly a syntax file (found in syntax/melt.vim) completed with a few coding styles rules (ftplugin/melt.vim).
You can found more about MELT here: http://gcc-melt.org/
One of the good point is that it handles C code written in a code_chunk.
You might just need to untar the archive into our vim directory to use to use it.
